            <p>
                Hi there, my name is Kerry Roger, I'm 36 years old and I am from (a popular city). A year ago, as I
                watched my two girlfriends smiling for the wedding photographer in their tight dresses, I wished I felt
                as confident аs them. <b>I almost burst out of my XL dress</b>, and when I sat down, I felt my sleeves
                straining so badly, I thought it was going to tear open.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>It had been such a struggle to find something to wear.</b> After ordering countless outfits online (
                I felt
                ashamed to go to physical stores) and sending them all back, I’d end up settling on the best of a bad
                bunch.
                <br>
                I’d always been a bit bigger than the other girls - my classmates, university colleagues, and
                girlfriends. <b>After I got married and gave birth to my kid (I was 31 back then), things just got
                    worse.</b>
                Till my kid turned 3 years old, I ate leftover cakes every single day, and ordered pizza takeaways for
                dinner. I felt frustrated - <b>I wanted to slim down but I felt powerless when it comes to food.</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                At first, I turned to meal-replacement shakes and cut out carbs. Within 2 weeks I’d lost 8 kg, but I was
                so hungry I couldn’t concentrate enough to deal with my tasks at work. So I stopped... <b>and quickly
                    not
                    only regained all the weight I’d lost but the scale was going up like crazy.</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                <i><b>I wasn't the only one who found my jelly-like belly repulsive</b>.</i>
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>My husband began to avoid sex with me</b>. The friends who hadn't seen me in a while remarked with
                concern
                how much I had changed…
                <br>
                <br>
                Feeling fed up with being rejected by my husband - I decided to make a change. My experience with diets
                had convinced me that <b>it was all about starving yourself</b>, which I didn’t want to do, so I
                purchased a
                gym card.
                <br>
                When I entered the gym, I felt so anxious that everyone was staring at me, as if judging me for being
                “so big” that I just ran out of the building like I was escaping from a nightmare.
                I was feeling pretty frustrated… and when I stood on the scale at home, I saw that <b>I was about to
                    “hit”
                    90 kilos</b> - much more than I’d expected - tears began blurring my vision.

            <h2>Starvation and gym attempts didn’t work… led to divorce.</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>After my failure with diets and gym visits, my real drama started. I fought with my husband every day. In
                front of the kid. He started calling me hysteric pork and other derogatory names. As expected, <b>the
                    relationship with my husband was getting toxic</b> for both of us. We got divorced…

                At that time <b>I was not only fat, but also dumped… in total despair</b>. </p>

            <h3>How to lose weight in the easy way</h3>
            <p>Thank God, my depression and obesity didn’t last forever, all thanks to a chat with an old friend of mine
                - Jeanne, my former classmate who, just like me, used to be the chubby girl in her early years and
                struggled to lose weight since a teenager. She comforted me about my failed attempt to train at the gym,
                telling me, <b>‘You didn’t miss anything. You can lose weight without sweating there, I myself managed
                    to
                    do it without stepping foot inside the gym.’</b> To prove me she was right, she sent me pictures of
                herself.
                I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b> She had melted off!!!</b> She had <b>lost 15 kilos in just 2 weeks</b>, thanks to taking a product
                containing
                thousands of natural ingredients <b>that speed up the metabolism</b>. Impatiently, I typed: TELL ME THE
                NAME OF
                IT! She sent me a link to <b>the official page of the product - <a class="product"
                        href="../../../c/index.php?lang=de">Uthin Triple Slim</a>.</b></p>
            <p>It turned out that this thing is <b>THE ONLY EASY weight-loss method</b> that gives results without
                counting
                calories like a mathematician or sweating to death in front of the whole neighborhood like an idiot at
                the gym.</p>
